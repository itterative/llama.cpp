# Contributors

The project differentiates between 3 levels of contributors:

- Contributors: people who have contributed before (no special privileges)
- Collaborators (Triage): people with significant contributions, who may be responsible for some parts of the code, and are expected to maintain and review contributions for the code they own
- Maintainers: responsible for reviewing and merging PRs, after approval from the code owners

# AI Usage Policy

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> AI-generated code is allowed. You are 100% responsible for every line, however it was produced.
>
> Undisclosed AI usage may result in your account being permanently banned from contributing to the project.
>
> Detailed information regarding permissible and restricted uses of AI can be found in the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file.

If AI is used to generate any portion of the code, contributors must adhere to the following requirements:

1. Explicitly disclose the manner in which AI was employed.
2. Check for an existing PR addressing the same change; if one exists, comment there to work with its author instead of opening a duplicate.
3. Perform a comprehensive manual review prior to submitting the pull request. A proper code review usually takes something like one hour per 200-400 LOC and you should be spending **at least that much time on code review alone**.
4. Be prepared to explain every line of code you submit when asked about it by a maintainer.
5. It is strictly prohibited to use AI to write your posts for you (bug reports, feature requests, pull request descriptions, Github discussions, responding to humans, ...).

For more info, please refer to the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file.

# Pull requests (for contributors & collaborators)

### Before you start

- Search for existing discussions and PRs first - duplicates will likely be closed without questions.
- Features must begin with an issue, not a PR - let interest accumulate before writing code; niche features may only land as an example/tool, or on a private fork.
- Bug-fix PRs must include a reproducible issue and a regression test that fails before your change and passes after. Fixes without a test may be closed without review.
- New CLI or public API additions carry a **higher bar** than internal changes - justify why an existing mechanism doesn't suffice.
- Meeting all of the above still doesn't guarantee a merge - see [Pull requests (for maintainers)](#pull-requests-for-maintainers).
- If you are a new contributor
    - Limit your open PRs to 1
    - Do not submit trivial fixes (e.g. typos, formatting changes)

### Preparing your PR

- llama.cpp uses the ggml tensor library for model evaluation. If you are unfamiliar with ggml, consider taking a look at the [examples in the ggml repository](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/tree/master/examples/). [simple](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/tree/master/examples/simple) shows the bare minimum for using ggml. [gpt-2](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/tree/master/examples/gpt-2) has minimal implementations for language model inference using GPT-2. [mnist](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/tree/master/examples/mnist) demonstrates how to train and evaluate a simple image classifier
- Test your changes:
  - Execute [the full CI locally on your machine](ci/README.md) before publishing
  - Verify that the perplexity and the performance are not affected negatively by your changes (use `llama-perplexity` and `llama-bench`)
  - If you modified the `ggml` source, run the `test-backend-ops` tool to check whether different backend implementations of the `ggml` operators produce consistent results (this requires access to at least two different `ggml` backends)
  - If you modified a `ggml` operator or added a new one, add the corresponding test cases to `test-backend-ops`
- Create separate PRs for each feature or fix:
  - Avoid combining unrelated changes in a single PR
  - When adding support for a new model or feature, focus on **CPU support only** in the initial PR unless you have a good reason not to. Add support for other backends like CUDA in follow-up PRs
  - In particular, adding new data types (extension of the `ggml_type` enum) carries with it a disproportionate maintenance burden. As such, to add a new quantization type you will need to meet the following *additional* criteria *at minimum*:
    - convert a small model to GGUF using the new type and upload it to HuggingFace
    - provide [perplexity](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/tools/perplexity) comparisons to FP16/BF16 (whichever is the native precision) as well as to types of similar size
    - provide KL divergence data calculated vs. the FP16/BF16 (whichever is the native precision) version for both the new type as well as types of similar size
    - provide [performance data](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/tools/llama-bench) for the new type in comparison to types of similar size on pure CPU
- Consider allowing write access to your branch for faster reviews, as reviewers can push commits directly

### After submitting your PR

- Expect requests for modifications to ensure the code meets llama.cpp's standards for quality and long-term maintainability
- Maintainers will rely on your insights and approval when making a final decision to approve and merge a PR
- If your PR becomes stale, rebase it on top of latest `master` to get maintainers attention
- Consider adding yourself to [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) to indicate your availability for fixing related issues and reviewing related PRs

# Pull requests (for maintainers)

- Squash-merge PRs
- Use the following format for the squashed commit title: `<module> : <commit title> (#<issue_number>)`. For example: `utils : fix typo in utils.py (#1234)`
- Optionally pick a `<module>` from here: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/wiki/Modules
- Let other maintainers merge their own PRs
- When merging a PR, make sure you have a good understanding of the changes
- If a PR does not warrant a new release, add `[no release]` in the squashed commit to spare CI resources
- Be mindful of maintenance: most of the work going into a feature happens after the PR is merged. If the PR author is not committed to contribute long-term, someone else needs to take responsibility (you)
- Add the ["merge ready"](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+draft%3Ano+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22merge+ready%22+) label to a PR to indicate when a PR can be fast-merged without waiting for 2 independent reviews. [(more info)](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/26178)
- Wait for CI results before merging

Maintainers reserve the right to decline review or close pull requests for any reason, without any questions, particularly under any of the following conditions:
- The proposed change is already mentioned in the roadmap or an existing issue, and it has been assigned to someone.
- The pull request duplicates an existing one.
- The contributor fails to adhere to this contributing guide or the AI policy.
- The change doesn't fit the existing architecture, or is too complex to justify its benefit.

# Coding guidelines

- Avoid adding third-party dependencies, extra files, extra headers, etc.
- Always consider cross-compatibility with other operating systems and architectures
- Avoid fancy-looking modern STL constructs, use basic `for` loops, avoid templates, keep it simple
- Vertical alignment makes things more readable and easier to batch edit
- Clean-up any trailing whitespaces, use 4 spaces for indentation, brackets on the same line, `void * ptr`, `int & a`
- Use sized integer types such as `int32_t` in the public API, e.g. `size_t` may also be appropriate for allocation sizes or byte offsets
- Declare structs with `struct foo {}` instead of `typedef struct foo {} foo`
    - In C++ code omit optional `struct` and `enum` keyword whenever they are not necessary
    ```cpp
    // OK
    llama_context * ctx;
    const llama_rope_type rope_type;

    // not OK
    struct llama_context * ctx;
    const enum llama_rope_type rope_type;
    ```

    _(NOTE: this guideline is yet to be applied to the `llama.cpp` codebase. New code should follow this guideline.)_

- Try to follow the existing patterns in the code (indentation, spaces, etc.). In case of doubt use `clang-format` (from clang-tools v15+) to format the added code
- For anything not covered in the current guidelines, refer to the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)
- Tensors store data in row-major order. We refer to dimension 0 as columns, 1 as rows, 2 as matrices
- Matrix multiplication is unconventional: [`C = ggml_mul_mat(ctx, A, B)`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/880e352277fc017df4d5794f0c21c44e1eae2b84/ggml.h#L1058-L1064) means $C^T = A B^T \Leftrightarrow C = B A^T.$

# Naming guidelines

- Use `snake_case` for function, variable and type names
- Naming usually optimizes for longest common prefix (see https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/pull/302#discussion_r1243240963)

    ```cpp
    // not OK
    int small_number;
    int big_number;

    // OK
    int number_small;
    int number_big;
    ```

- Enum values are always in upper case and prefixed with the enum name

    ```cpp
    enum llama_vocab_type {
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_NONE = 0,
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_SPM  = 1,
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_BPE  = 2,
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_WPM  = 3,
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_UGM  = 4,
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_RWKV = 5,
    };
    ```

- The general naming pattern is `<class>_<method>`, with `<method>` being `<action>_<noun>`

    ```cpp
    llama_model_init();           // class: "llama_model",         method: "init"
    llama_sampler_chain_remove(); // class: "llama_sampler_chain", method: "remove"
    llama_sampler_get_seed();     // class: "llama_sampler",       method: "get_seed"
    llama_set_embeddings();       // class: "llama_context",       method: "set_embeddings"
    llama_n_threads();            // class: "llama_context",       method: "n_threads"
    llama_adapter_lora_free();    // class: "llama_adapter_lora",  method: "free"
    ```

    - The `get` `<action>` can be omitted
    - The `<noun>` can be omitted if not necessary
    - The `_context` suffix of the `<class>` is optional. Use it to disambiguate symbols when needed
    - Use `init`/`free` for constructor/destructor `<action>`

- Use the `_t` suffix when a type is supposed to be opaque to the user - it's not relevant to them if it is a struct or anything else

    ```cpp
    typedef struct llama_context * llama_context_t;

    enum llama_pooling_type llama_pooling_type(const llama_context_t ctx);
    ```

    _(NOTE: this guideline is yet to be applied to the `llama.cpp` codebase. New code should follow this guideline)_

- C/C++ filenames are all lowercase with dashes. Headers use the `.h` extension. Source files use the `.c` or `.cpp` extension
- Python filenames are all lowercase with underscores

- _(TODO: abbreviations usage)_

# Preprocessor directives

- _(TODO: add guidelines with examples and apply them to the codebase)_

    ```cpp
    #ifdef FOO
    #endif // FOO
    ```

# Code maintenance

- Existing code should have designated collaborators and/or maintainers specified in the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file responsible for:
  - Reviewing and merging related PRs
  - Fixing related bugs
  - Providing developer guidance/support

- When adding or modifying a large piece of code:
  - If you are a collaborator, make sure to add yourself to [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) to indicate your availability for reviewing related PRs
  - If you are a contributor, find an existing collaborator who is willing to review and maintain your code long-term
  - Provide the necessary CI workflow (and hardware) to test your changes (see [ci/README.md](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/ci))

- New code should follow the guidelines (coding, naming, etc.) outlined in this document. Exceptions are allowed in isolated, backend-specific parts of the code that do not interface directly with the `ggml` interfaces.
  _(NOTE: for legacy reasons, existing code is not required to follow this guideline)_

- For changes in server, please make sure to refer to the [server development documentation](./tools/server/README-dev.md)

# Documentation

- Documentation is a community effort
- When you need to look into the source code to figure out how to use an API consider adding a short summary to the header file for future reference
- When you notice incorrect or outdated documentation, please update it

# Android

## Build GUI binding using Android Studio

Import the `examples/llama.android` directory into Android Studio, then perform a Gradle sync and build the project.
![Project imported into Android Studio](./android/imported-into-android-studio.jpg)

This Android binding supports hardware acceleration up to `SME2` for **Arm** and `AMX` for **x86-64** CPUs on Android and ChromeOS devices.
It automatically detects the host's hardware to load compatible kernels. As a result, it runs seamlessly on both the latest premium devices and older devices that may lack modern CPU features or have limited RAM, without requiring any manual configuration.

A minimal Android app frontend is included to showcase the binding’s core functionalities:
1.	**Parse GGUF metadata** via `GgufMetadataReader` from either a `ContentResolver` provided `Uri` from shared storage, or a local `File` from your app's private storage.
2.	**Obtain a `InferenceEngine`** instance through the `AiChat` facade and load your selected model via its app-private file path.
3.	**Send a raw user prompt** for automatic template formatting, prefill, and batch decoding. Then collect the generated tokens in a Kotlin `Flow`.

For a production-ready experience that leverages advanced features such as system prompts and benchmarks, plus friendly UI features such as model management and Arm feature visualizer, check out [Arm AI Chat](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arm.aichat) on Google Play.
This project is made possible through a collaborative effort by Arm's **CT-ML**, **CE-ML** and **STE** groups:

## Build CLI on Android using Termux

[Termux](https://termux.dev/en/) is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app (no root required). As of writing, Termux is available experimentally in the Google Play Store; otherwise, it may be obtained directly from the project repo or on F-Droid.

With Termux, you can install and run `llama.cpp` as if the environment were Linux. Once in the Termux shell:

```
$ apt update && apt upgrade -y
$ apt install git cmake libandroid-spawn
```

Then, follow the [build instructions](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/build.md), specifically for CMake.

Once the binaries are built, download your model of choice (e.g., from Hugging Face). It's recommended to place it in the `~/` directory for best performance:

```
$ curl -L {model-url} -o ~/{model}.gguf
```

Then, if you are not already in the repo directory, `cd` into `llama.cpp` and:

```
$ ./build/bin/llama-cli -m ~/{model}.gguf -c {context-size} -p "{your-prompt}"
```

Here, we show `llama-cli`, but any of the executables under `examples` should work, in theory. Be sure to set `context-size` to a reasonable number (say, 4096) to start with; otherwise, memory could spike and kill your terminal.

To see what it might look like visually, here's an old demo of an interactive session running on a Pixel 5 phone:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/271616/225014776-1d567049-ad71-4ef2-b050-55b0b3b9274c.mp4

## Cross-compile CLI using Android NDK
It's possible to build `llama.cpp` for Android on your host system via CMake and the Android NDK. If you are interested in this path, ensure you already have an environment prepared to cross-compile programs for Android (i.e., install the Android SDK/NDK and set `ANDROID_NDK` to the NDK root). Note that, unlike desktop environments, the Android environment ships with a limited set of native libraries, and so only those libraries are available to CMake when building with the Android NDK (see: https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/stable_apis.)

Once you're ready and have cloned `llama.cpp`, invoke the following in the project directory:

```
$ cmake \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
  -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a \
  -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-28 \
  -DGGML_NATIVE=OFF \
  -DGGML_OPENMP=OFF \
  -DGGML_LLAMAFILE=OFF \
  -DLLAMA_OPENSSL=OFF \
  -B build-android
```

Notes:
  - `GGML_NATIVE=OFF` is required for cross-compilation because the host CPU is not the Android target CPU
  - While later versions of Android NDK ship with OpenMP, it must still be installed by CMake as a dependency, which is not supported at this time
  - `llamafile` does not appear to support Android devices (see: https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/issues/325)
  - `LLAMA_OPENSSL=OFF` avoids depending on OpenSSL, which is not part of the Android NDK stable native API set

The above command configures a portable Android `arm64-v8a` build. Do not add a global `-march` flag unless you intentionally want to raise the baseline instruction set for every compiled source.

For optional KleidiAI acceleration on Android `arm64-v8a`, see the [Arm KleidiAI section in build.md](./build.md#arm-kleidiai).

Feel free to adjust the Android ABI for your target. Once the project is configured:

```
$ cmake --build build-android --config Release -j{n}
$ cmake --install build-android --prefix {install-dir} --config Release
```

After installing, go ahead and download the model of your choice to your host system. Then:

```
$ adb shell "mkdir /data/local/tmp/llama.cpp"
$ adb push {install-dir} /data/local/tmp/llama.cpp/
$ adb push {model}.gguf /data/local/tmp/llama.cpp/
$ adb shell
```

In the `adb shell`:

```
$ cd /data/local/tmp/llama.cpp
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib ./bin/llama-simple -m {model}.gguf -c {context-size} -p "{your-prompt}"
```

That's it!

Be aware that Android will not find the library path `lib` on its own, so we must specify `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in order to run the installed executables. Android does support `RPATH` in later API levels, so this could change in the future. Refer to the previous section for information about `context-size` (very important!) and running other `examples`.
# Auto-Parser Architecture

The auto-parser automatically analyzes chat templates to determine how to parse model outputs, including content, reasoning, and tool calls.

## Overview

The unified auto-parser uses a pure differential, compositional approach (inspired by the `git diff` algorithm) to analyze chat templates:

**Core Philosophy**:

- **Minimize Hardcoded Patterns**: All markers extracted through template comparison (the only heuristic is JSON detection to distinguish `JSON_NATIVE` from tag-based formats)
- **Compositional Architecture**: Separate analyzer structs for reasoning, content, and tools — each responsible for its own analysis and parser construction

**Analysis + Parser Building in Two Steps**:

1. `autoparser::autoparser tmpl_analysis(tmpl)` — runs all differential comparisons and populates the analysis structs
2. `autoparser::peg_generator::generate_parser(tmpl, generation_params, tmpl_analysis)` — uses the analysis to build a PEG parser and optional GBNF grammar

## Data Structures

All structs are defined in [common/chat-auto-parser.h](common/chat-auto-parser.h).

### Top-Level: `autoparser` (main analyzer and generator)

[common/chat-auto-parser.h:367-388](common/chat-auto-parser.h#L367-L388) — top-level analysis result aggregating `jinja_caps`, `reasoning`, `content`, and `tools` sub-analyses, plus `preserved_tokens` (union of all non-empty markers).

### `analyze_reasoning`

[common/chat-auto-parser.h:254-274](common/chat-auto-parser.h#L254-L274) — reasoning analysis result: `mode` enum, `start` marker (e.g. `<think>`), and `end` marker (e.g. `</think>`).

### `analyze_content`

[common/chat-auto-parser.h:280-295](common/chat-auto-parser.h#L280-L295) — content analysis result: `mode` enum, `start`/`end` markers, and `requires_nonnull_content` flag.

### `analyze_tools` and its sub-structs

- [common/chat-auto-parser.h:176-194](common/chat-auto-parser.h#L176-L194) — `tool_format_analysis`: `mode` enum, `section_start/end`, `per_call_start/end`, JSON field names (`function_field`, `name_field`, `args_field`, `id_field`, `gen_id_field`), and format flags (`fun_name_is_key`, `tools_array_wrapped`)
- [common/chat-auto-parser.h:196-200](common/chat-auto-parser.h#L196-L200) — `tool_function_analysis`: `name_prefix`, `name_suffix`, `close` markers around function names
- [common/chat-auto-parser.h:202-210](common/chat-auto-parser.h#L202-L210) — `tool_arguments_analysis`: `start/end` container markers, `name_prefix/suffix`, `value_prefix/suffix`, `separator`
- [common/chat-auto-parser.h:212-217](common/chat-auto-parser.h#L212-L217) — `tool_id_analysis`: `pos` enum, `prefix`/`suffix` markers around call ID values
- [common/chat-auto-parser.h:301-361](common/chat-auto-parser.h#L301-L361) — `analyze_tools`: aggregates the four sub-structs above

### Enums

**`reasoning_mode`**: How the template handles reasoning/thinking blocks.

| Value           | Description                                                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NONE`          | No reasoning markers detected                                                     |
| `TAG_BASED`     | Tag-based: `<think>...</think>` (start can be empty for delimiter-style formats)  |
| `TOOLS_ONLY`    | Reasoning only appears in tool call responses, not plain content                  |

**Generation Prompt & Reasoning Prefill**: Computed in `common_chat_templates_apply_jinja` before invoking either the specialized handlers or the auto-parser, by rendering the template twice — once with `add_generation_prompt=false` and once with `add_generation_prompt=true` — and storing the diff suffix as `generation_params::generation_prompt`. This string is propagated into `common_chat_params::generation_prompt` and `common_chat_parser_params::generation_prompt`.

The generation prompt is prepended to model output before PEG parsing via `wrap_for_generation_prompt()`. The portion *before* the reasoning start marker (if any) is prepended as a literal to ensure any boilerplate added by the template is consumed. The full string is also fed to the grammar sampler via `llama_sampler_accept` (stored in `common_params_sampling::grammar_prefill`), advancing the grammar past tokens already in the prompt. It is used to determine the reasoning budget sampler's initial state — COUNTING if the prefill tokens begin with the reasoning start sequence (but don't also contain the end sequence), IDLE otherwise.

**`grammar_prefill`** (`common_params_sampling`): The generation prompt string tokenized and accepted by the grammar sampler at init time. Only applied when `grammar_external` is false (i.e., the grammar was not set explicitly by the user).

Three outcomes for reasoning-prefill handling (in `generate_parser()`):

1. **Start+end in generation prompt** (e.g. `<think></think>\n`): the parser sees reasoning as opened and immediately closed; whitespace-only reasoning content is discarded.
2. **Only start in generation prompt** (e.g. `<think>\n`): the parser sees reasoning as already open.
3. **Start marker present but not at the end** (e.g. Apriel's `<|begin_assistant|>` followed by boilerplate): the marker is a template artifact; the start literal is cleared so reasoning uses delimiter-style (end-only). For templates that ignore `add_generation_prompt` (empty diff), the rendered `data.prompt` is used as fallback — but only for non-TOOLS_ONLY modes, since in TOOLS_ONLY the start tag is model-generated and may appear in prior conversation turns.

**`content_mode`**: How the template wraps assistant content.

| Value                    | Description                                                    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PLAIN`                  | No content markers                                             |
| `ALWAYS_WRAPPED`         | Content always wrapped: `<response>...</response>`             |
| `WRAPPED_WITH_REASONING` | Content wrapped only when reasoning is present                 |

**`tool_format`**: Classification of tool call structure.

| Value            | Description                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NONE`           | No tool support detected                                         |
| `JSON_NATIVE`    | Pure JSON: `{"name": "X", "arguments": {...}}`                   |
| `TAG_WITH_JSON`  | Tag-based with JSON args: `<function=X>{...}</function>`         |
| `TAG_WITH_TAGGED`| Tag-based with tagged args: `<param=key>value</param>`           |

**`call_id_position`**: Where call IDs appear in tag-based formats.

| Value                    | Description                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `NONE`                   | No call ID support detected                  |
| `PRE_FUNC_NAME`          | Before function name                         |
| `BETWEEN_FUNC_AND_ARGS`  | Between function name and arguments          |
| `POST_ARGS`              | After arguments                              |

## Tool Calling Formats

### JSON_NATIVE

**Structure**: The entire tool call (function name, arguments, values) is in JSON format. Optional enclosing tags around the section.

**Detection**: Function name appears inside a JSON structure (quotes preceded by `{` or `:`).

**Examples**:

Standard OpenAI-style:

```json
<tool_call>
{"name": "get_weather", "arguments": {"location": "Paris", "unit": "celsius"}}
</tool_call>
```

Mistral Nemo with array wrapper:

```json
[TOOL_CALLS]
[{"name": "calculate", "arguments": {"expr": "2+2"}}]
```

Function name as JSON key (Apertus style):

```json
{"get_weather": {"location": "Paris"}}
```

---

### TAG_WITH_JSON

**Structure**: Function name is outside JSON, in tag attributes or XML-style tags. Arguments are a JSON object.

**Detection**: Function name not in JSON, but argument names appear in JSON context.

**Examples**:

Functionary v3.1:

```xml
<function=get_weather>{"location": "Paris", "unit": "celsius"}</function>
```

MiniMax:

```xml
<minimax:tool_call>
<tool_name>calculate</tool_name>
<arguments>{"expr": "2+2"}</arguments>
</minimax:tool_call>
```

---

### TAG_WITH_TAGGED

**Structure**: Both function name and argument names are in XML-style tags. String values are unquoted; non-string values are JSON-formatted.

**Detection**: Neither function name nor argument names appear in a JSON context.

**Examples**:

Qwen/Hermes XML format:

```xml
<function=get_weather>
<param=location>Paris</param>
<param=unit>celsius</param>
</function>
```

Mixed types:

```xml
<function=calculate>
<param=expr>2+2</param>
<param=precision>2</param>
<param=options>{"round": true}</param>
</function>
```

String values (`Paris`, `celsius`, `2+2`) are unquoted; `options` (object type) is JSON-formatted.

## Entry Point

The auto-parser is invoked in [common/chat.cpp:1280-1310](common/chat.cpp#L1280-L1310) in `common_chat_templates_apply_jinja`. A few specialized templates are handled first (Ministral/Magistral Large 3, GPT-OSS with `<|channel|>`, Functionary v3.2 with `>>>all`), then the auto-parser handles everything else via `autoparser::autoparser` + `peg_generator::generate_parser`.

## Algorithm Details

### Core Mechanism: Differential Comparison

All analysis phases use the same factorized comparison function declared in [common/chat-auto-parser-helpers.h:68](common/chat-auto-parser-helpers.h#L68):

```cpp
compare_variants(tmpl, params_A, params_modifier)
```

This creates variant B by applying a modifier lambda to a copy of `params_A`, renders both through the template, and computes a `diff_split` ([common/chat-auto-parser.h:28-37](common/chat-auto-parser.h#L28-L37)):

- `prefix` — common prefix between A and B
- `suffix` — common suffix between A and B
- `left` — unique to variant A
- `right` — unique to variant B

The diff is computed via `calculate_diff_split()`, which finds the longest-common-prefix and longest-common-suffix, then iteratively moves incomplete `<...>` or `[...]` markers from the prefix/suffix into left/right until stable (tag boundary fixing).

Text is segmentized into markers and non-marker fragments using `segmentize_markers()`, which splits on `<...>` and `[...]` boundaries.

### Phase 1: Reasoning Analysis

**R1 — `compare_reasoning_presence()`**: Compares assistant message with vs without a `reasoning_content` field.

- Searches `diff.right` (output with reasoning) for the reasoning content needle
- Uses PEG parsers to find surrounding markers:
  - If both pre/post markers found in `diff.right` → `TAG_BASED`
  - If both found but post marker only in the full output B → `TAG_BASED` (template forces markers; handled via prefill)
  - If only post marker found → `TAG_BASED` (delimiter-style, empty start)
- Sets `reasoning.start` and `reasoning.end`

**R2 — `compare_thinking_enabled()`**: Compares `enable_thinking=false` vs `true` with a generation prompt.

- Detects template-added reasoning markers: `enable_thinking=true` appends a non-empty marker → sets `reasoning.start`, mode = `TAG_BASED`
- Handles the reverse case (`enable_thinking=false` appends the marker instead): extracts both start (from the preceding segment) and end markers; mode = `TAG_BASED`
- The reasoning prefill (markers added by the template) is later extracted in `common_chat_templates_apply_jinja` and prepended to model output before parsing

**R3 — `compare_reasoning_scope()`**: Compares assistant message with reasoning+text-content vs reasoning+tool-calls.

- Only runs if `jinja_caps.supports_tool_calls`
- Detects `TOOLS_ONLY`: reasoning content present in B (with tools) but not in A (with text content)
- Extracts reasoning markers from the tool call output using PEG parsers

### Phase 2: Content Analysis

**C1**: Two comparisons in the `analyze_content` constructor:

- Comparison 1: content-only output vs tool-call output → `diff_tools`
- Comparison 2: content-only output vs reasoning+empty-content output → `diff_reasoning`

Classification logic:

- `PLAIN`: `diff_tools.left` equals the response string (content is the entire diff, no wrapper)
- `ALWAYS_WRAPPED`: markers found surrounding the content text in `pure_content` → extracts `start`/`end`

### Phase 3: Tool Call Analysis

**T1 — `analyze_tool_calls()`**: Compares no-tools vs with-tools output.

- Extracts the tool call section as `diff.right`
- Calls `analyze_tool_call_format()` which first strips reasoning markers from the haystack, then:
  - Calls `in_json_haystack()` for both function name and argument name needles
  - `in_json_haystack()` uses a PEG parser to check whether the needle appears in a JSON context (preceded by `{` or `:` with surrounding quotes)
  - If function name is in JSON → `JSON_NATIVE` → `analyze_tool_call_format_json_native()`
  - If function name not in JSON, arg name is in JSON → `TAG_WITH_JSON`
  - If neither in JSON → `TAG_WITH_TAGGED`
  - `analyze_tool_call_format_json_native()`: parses the JSON object, matches field values to needles to populate `name_field`, `args_field`, `id_field`, `gen_id_field`; detects `tools_array_wrapped`; extracts `section_start`/`section_end`
  - `analyze_tool_call_format_non_json()`: uses PEG parsers on the haystack to find up to two opening markers (section + per-call) then up to two closing markers

**T2 — `check_per_call_markers()`**: Compares 1 call vs 2 calls.

- Computes a secondary diff of the second call portion vs the common suffix
- If the second call content starts with `section_start` → the section marker is actually per-call → moves `section_start/end` to `per_call_start/end` and clears the section markers

**T3 — `extract_function_markers()`**: Compares function name `FUN_FIRST` vs `FUN_SECOND` (two different named functions).

- Finds where the function name appears in `diff.left`
- Extracts `function.name_prefix` from the common prefix up to the function marker, and `function.name_suffix` from after the name up to the next marker
- Extends `name_suffix` into `diff.suffix` (to the first marker for TAG_WITH_TAGGED; to the first `{` or `[` for TAG_WITH_JSON)
- Extracts `function.close` from after the last argument value up to the per-call/section end marker

**T4 — `analyze_arguments()`** (TAG_WITH_TAGGED only):

- **A1 `extract_argument_name_markers()`**: Compares `arg_name_A` vs `arg_name_B` (two different argument names).
  - Finds shared surrounding structure → `arguments.name_prefix`, `arguments.name_suffix`
- **A2 `extract_argument_value_markers()`**: Compares argument value `"XXXX"` vs `"YYYY"` (same arg, different value).
  - Finds markers surrounding the value → `arguments.value_prefix`, `arguments.value_suffix`

**T5 — `extract_argument_separator()`**: Compares 1 argument vs 2 arguments (same function).

- Uses `until_common_prefix(diff.right, ARG_FIRST, ARG_SECOND)` to find what separates the two argument blocks

**T6 — `extract_args_markers()`**: Compares 0 arguments vs 1 argument.

- Uses `until_common_prefix()` and `after_common_suffix()` with the empty and single-arg JSON strings as anchors to find container markers (`arguments.start`, `arguments.end`)

**T7 — `extract_call_id_markers()`**: Compares call IDs `"call00001"` vs `"call99999"`.

- Determines whether function name appears in `diff.prefix` or `diff.suffix` to classify position:
  - Function name in prefix only → `BETWEEN_FUNC_AND_ARGS` or `POST_ARGS` (further distinguished by where `{` appears)
  - Function name in suffix only → `PRE_FUNC_NAME`
- Extracts `call_id.prefix` and `call_id.suffix` markers around the call ID value
- Clears `per_call_end` if it incorrectly incorporated the call ID suffix

### Workarounds

A workaround array in `common/chat-diff-analyzer.cpp` applies post-hoc patches after analysis. Each workaround is a lambda that inspects the template source and overrides analysis results. Current workarounds:

1. **Old Qwen/DeepSeek thinking templates** — source contains `content.split('</think>')` but not `<SPECIAL_12>`: sets `reasoning.mode = TAG_BASED` with `<think>`/`</think>` markers if no reasoning was detected
2. **Granite 3.3** — source contains specific "Write your thoughts" text: forces `TAG_BASED` reasoning with `<think>`/`</think>` and `WRAPPED_WITH_REASONING` content with `<response>`/`</response>`
3. **Cohere Command R+** — source contains `<|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>`: sets `ALWAYS_WRAPPED` content mode if no content start is already set
4. **Functionary 3.1** — source contains `set has_code_interpreter`: forces `PLAIN` content, specific `per_call_start/end`, clears preserved tokens to only keep Functionary-specific markers
5. **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen** — source contains `tool▁calls▁begin` markers: overrides tool section/per-call markers with the correct Unicode block characters

### Parser Building

Each analyzer struct (`analyze_reasoning`, `analyze_content`, `analyze_tools`) implements `build_parser(parser_build_context&)`. They share a `parser_build_context` that carries the PEG builder, inference inputs, the pre-built reasoning parser, and a pointer to the content analyzer.

#### Reasoning Parser (`analyze_reasoning::build_parser`)

| Mode                                          | Parser                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not extracting reasoning                      | `eps()`                                                                   |
| `TAG_BASED` or `TOOLS_ONLY` (non-empty start) | `optional(start + reasoning(until(end)) + end + space())`                 |
| `TAG_BASED` or `TOOLS_ONLY` (empty start)     | `optional(reasoning(until(end)) + end + space())` — delimiter-style       |

Note: The start marker may be empty either because the analyzer detected delimiter-style reasoning, or because `generate_parser()` cleared a template artifact start marker (see Generation Prompt & Reasoning Prefill above). Whitespace-only reasoning content (e.g. from a `<think></think>` prefill) is discarded by the mapper.

#### Content Parser (`analyze_content::build_parser`)

| Condition                              | Parser                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `json_schema` present                  | `reasoning + space() + content(schema(json(), "response-format", ...)) + end()` |
| Tools present                          | Dispatches to `analyze_tools::build_parser()`                                   |
| `ALWAYS_WRAPPED` with reasoning        | `reasoning + start + content(until(end)) + end + end()`                         |
| `ALWAYS_WRAPPED` without reasoning     | `content(until(start)) + start + content(until(end)) + end + end()`             |
| Default (PLAIN)                        | `reasoning + content(rest()) + end()`                                           |

#### Tool Parsers (`analyze_tools::build_parser`)

Dispatches by `format.mode`:

**`build_tool_parser_json_native()`**: Calls `p.standard_json_tools()` which internally dispatches to:

- `build_json_tools_function_is_key()` — function name is the JSON key: `{"get_weather": {...}}`
- `build_json_tools_nested_keys()` — nested: `{"function": {"name": "X", "arguments": {...}}}`
- `build_json_tools_flat_keys()` — flat: `{"name": "X", "arguments": {...}}`

Handles content wrappers, array wrapping (`tools_array_wrapped`), parallel calls, and `parameter_order`.

**`build_tool_parser_tag_json()`**: For each tool function:

```text
tool_open(name_prefix + tool_name(literal(name)) + name_suffix) +
    call_id_section +
    tool_args(schema(json(), tool_schema))
  [+ function.close if non-empty]
```

Wrapped in per-call markers (with optional parallel call repetition) then optionally in section markers.

**`build_tool_parser_tag_tagged()`**: For each tool function, builds one parser per argument:

- String types: `tool_arg_string_value(schema(until(value_suffix), ...))`
- JSON types: `tool_arg_json_value(schema(json(), ...))`
- Required args are plain; optional args wrapped in `optional()`
- Arguments joined with `space()` between consecutive parsers

For closing: uses `function.close` if present; otherwise uses `peek(per_call_end)` to avoid premature close during partial streaming; falls back to `tool_close(space())` to trigger mapper callbacks.

All three tool parsers return:

```text
reasoning + optional(content(until(trigger_marker))) + tool_calls + end()
```

Each returned parser is wrapped by `wrap_for_generation_prompt()`, which prepends a literal for any boilerplate prefix of the generation prompt (the portion before the reasoning start marker).

## Mapper

`common_chat_peg_mapper` maps PEG parse results (AST nodes) into `common_chat_msg` structures. Key design:

- **Buffered arguments**: Before `tool_name` is known, argument text goes to `args_buffer`; once the name is set, the buffer is flushed to `current_tool->arguments`
- **`args_target()`**: Returns a reference to whichever destination is currently active (buffer or tool args), eliminating branching
- **`closing_quote_pending`**: Tracks whether a closing `"` needs to be appended when a string argument value is finalized (for schema-declared string types in tagged format)
- **Whitespace-only reasoning**: Reasoning content that consists entirely of whitespace (e.g. from a `<think></think>` prefill) is cleared so the message shows no reasoning
- **Brace auto-closing**: At tool close, unclosed `{` braces are closed automatically

## Adding Support for New Templates

To support a new template format:

1. **If it follows standard patterns** — The auto-parser should detect it automatically. Run `test-chat-auto-parser <template_path>` to verify markers are correctly extracted.
2. **If differential analysis extracts incorrect markers** — Add a workaround lambda to the `workarounds` vector in `common/chat-diff-analyzer.cpp`. Inspect the template source for a unique identifying substring.
3. **If it needs fundamentally different handling** — Add a dedicated handler function in `chat.cpp` before the auto-parser block (as done for GPT-OSS, Functionary v3.2, and Ministral).

## Edge Cases and Quirks

1. **Generation Prompt & Reasoning Prefill**: The generation prompt is extracted by diffing `add_generation_prompt=false` vs `true` in `common_chat_templates_apply_jinja`, so it contains exactly what the template appends — avoiding false positives from prior conversation turns.
2. **Per-Call vs Per-Section Markers**: Some templates wrap each tool call individually (`per_call_start/end`); others wrap the entire section (`section_start/end`). T2 (`check_per_call_markers()`) disambiguates by checking if the second call in a two-call output starts with the section marker.
3. **Tag Boundary Fixing**: `calculate_diff_split()` iteratively adjusts prefix/suffix boundaries to avoid splitting `<tag>` or `[marker]` tokens, ensuring clean extraction.
4. **Call ID Side Effects**: When a call ID is detected, `per_call_end` may have been incorrectly set to include the call ID suffix. T7 clears `per_call_end` in this case.
5. **Tool Analysis Gating**: `analyze_tools` is only constructed (and all tool analysis phases run) when `jinja_caps.supports_tool_calls` is true. Within tool analysis, `check_per_call_markers()` (T2) only runs if `jinja_caps.supports_parallel_tool_calls`.
6. **`analyze_arguments()` Gating**: Within tool analysis, A1 and A2 (argument name/value marker extraction) only run for `TAG_WITH_TAGGED` format. `extract_argument_separator()` and `extract_args_markers()` run for all non-`JSON_NATIVE` formats.
7. **Undetected Tool Format**: If `analyze_tools` concludes tool calling is supported but cannot determine the format, `build_parser()` logs an error and returns `eps()` (graceful degradation) rather than aborting.
# Build llama.cpp locally

The main product of this project is the `llama` library. Its C-style interface can be found in [include/llama.h](../include/llama.h).

The project also includes many example programs and tools using the `llama` library. The examples range from simple, minimal code snippets to sophisticated sub-projects such as an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server.

**To get the Code:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
```

## CPU Build

Build llama.cpp using `CMake`:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

**Notes**:

- For faster compilation, add the `-j` argument to run multiple jobs in parallel, or use a generator that does this automatically such as Ninja. For example, `cmake --build build --config Release -j 8` will run 8 jobs in parallel.
- For faster repeated compilation, install [ccache](https://ccache.dev/)
- For debug builds, there are two cases:

    1. Single-config generators (e.g. default = `Unix Makefiles`; note that they just ignore the `--config` flag):

       ```bash
       cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
       cmake --build build
       ```

    2. Multi-config generators (`-G` param set to Visual Studio, XCode...):

       ```bash
       cmake -B build -G "Xcode"
       cmake --build build --config Debug
       ```

    For more details and a list of supported generators, see the [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).
- For static builds, add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`:
  ```
  cmake -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
  cmake --build build --config Release
  ```

- Building for Windows (x86, x64 and arm64) with MSVC or clang as compilers:
    - Install Visual Studio 2022, e.g. via the [Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). In the installer, select at least the following options (this also automatically installs the required additional tools like CMake,...):
    - Tab Workload: Desktop-development with C++
    - Tab Components (select quickly via search): C++-_CMake_ Tools for Windows, _Git_ for Windows, C++-_Clang_ Compiler for Windows, MS-Build Support for LLVM-Toolset (clang)
    - Please remember to always use a Developer Command Prompt / PowerShell for VS2022 for git, build, test
    - For Windows on ARM (arm64, WoA), build with:
      ```bash
      cmake --preset arm64-windows-llvm-release -D GGML_OPENMP_FETCH=ON
      cmake --build build-arm64-windows-llvm-release
      ```
      - Use `ARM64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` if you are building on an ARM64 machine.
      - `GGML_OPENMP_FETCH` downloads the official LLVM OpenMP runtime and requires Clang, 7-Zip and network access during configuration. CMake selects the runtime from the target architecture, so this also works when cross-compiling for WoA from x64. The extracted header, import library, DLL and OpenMP license are placed under `build/_deps`. The build copies `libomp.dll` and `LICENSE-LLVM-OpenMP` to the runtime output directory and installs them together. Omit the option to use CMake's normal OpenMP detection, or pass `-D GGML_OPENMP=OFF` to disable OpenMP.
    - For building with ninja generator and clang compiler as default:
      - Set path:
        ```
        set LIB=C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.22621.0\um\x64;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.41.34120\lib\x64\uwp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.22621.0\ucrt\x64
        ```
      - Run:
        ```bash
        cmake --preset x64-windows-llvm-release
        cmake --build build-x64-windows-llvm-release
        ```
- If you want HTTPS/TLS features, you may install OpenSSL development libraries. If not installed, the project will build and run without SSL support.
  - **Debian / Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
  - **Fedora / RHEL / Rocky / Alma:** `sudo dnf install openssl-devel`
  - **Arch / Manjaro:** `sudo pacman -S openssl`

## BLAS Build

Building the program with BLAS support may lead to some performance improvements in prompt processing using batch sizes higher than 32 (the default is 512). Using BLAS doesn't affect the generation performance. There are currently several different BLAS implementations available for build and use:

### Accelerate Framework

This is only available on Mac PCs and it's enabled by default. You can just build using the normal instructions.

### OpenBLAS

This provides BLAS acceleration using only the CPU. Make sure to have OpenBLAS installed on your machine.

- Using `CMake` on Linux:

    ```bash
    cmake -B build -DGGML_BLAS=ON -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

### BLIS

Check [BLIS.md](./backend/BLIS.md) for more information.

### Intel oneMKL

Building through oneAPI compilers will make avx_vnni instruction set available for intel processors that do not support avx512 and avx512_vnni. Please note that this build config **does not support Intel GPU**. For Intel GPU support, please refer to [llama.cpp for SYCL](./backend/SYCL.md).

- Using manual oneAPI installation:
  By default, `GGML_BLAS_VENDOR` is set to `Generic`, so if you already sourced intel environment script and assign `-DGGML_BLAS=ON` in cmake, the mkl version of Blas will automatically been selected. Otherwise please install oneAPI and follow the below steps:
    ```bash
    source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh # You can skip this step if  in oneapi-basekit docker image, only required for manual installation
    cmake -B build -DGGML_BLAS=ON -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icx -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpx -DGGML_NATIVE=ON
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

- Using oneAPI docker image:
  If you do not want to source the environment vars and install oneAPI manually, you can also build the code using intel docker container: [oneAPI-basekit](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/oneapi-basekit). Then, you can use the commands given above.

Check [Optimizing and Running LLaMA2 on Intel® CPU](https://builders.intel.com/solutionslibrary/optimizing-and-running-llama2-on-intel-cpu) for more information.

### Other BLAS libraries

Any other BLAS library can be used by setting the `GGML_BLAS_VENDOR` option. See the [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindBLAS.html#blas-lapack-vendors) for a list of supported vendors.

## Metal Build

On MacOS, Metal is enabled by default. Using Metal makes the computation run on the GPU.
To disable the Metal build at compile time use the `-DGGML_METAL=OFF` cmake option.

When built with Metal support, you can explicitly disable GPU inference with the `--n-gpu-layers 0` command-line argument.

## SYCL

SYCL is a higher-level programming model to improve programming productivity on various hardware accelerators.

llama.cpp based on SYCL is used to **support Intel GPU** (Data Center Max series, Flex series, Arc series, Built-in GPU and iGPU).

For detailed info, please refer to [llama.cpp for SYCL](./backend/SYCL.md).

## CUDA

This provides GPU acceleration using an NVIDIA GPU. Make sure to have the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) installed.

#### Download directly from NVIDIA
You may find the official downloads here: [NVIDIA developer site](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).


#### Compile and run inside a Fedora Toolbox Container
We also have a [guide](./backend/CUDA-FEDORA.md) for setting up CUDA toolkit in a Fedora [toolbox container](https://containertoolbx.org/).

**Recommended for:**
- ***Necessary*** for users of [Atomic Desktops for Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/); such as: [Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/) and [Kinoite](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/).
  - (there are no supported CUDA packages for these systems)
- ***Necessary*** for users that have a host that is not a: [Supported Nvidia CUDA Release Platform](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
  - (for example, you may have [Fedora 42 Beta](https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-42-beta/) as your host operating system)
- ***Convenient*** For those running [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) or [Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde), and want to keep their host system clean.
- *Optionally* toolbox packages are available: [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), [Red Hat Enterprise Linux >= 8.5](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux), or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)


### Compilation

Make sure to read the notes about the CPU build for general instructions for e.g. speeding up the compilation.

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Non-Native Builds

By default llama.cpp will be built for the hardware that is connected to the system at that time.
For a build covering all CUDA GPUs, disable `GGML_NATIVE`:

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_NATIVE=OFF
```

The resulting binary should run on all CUDA GPUs with optimal performance, though some just-in-time compilation may be required.

### Override Compute Capability Specifications

If `nvcc` cannot detect your gpu, you may get compile warnings such as:
 ```text
nvcc warning : Cannot find valid GPU for '-arch=native', default arch is used
```

One option is to do a non-native build as described above.
However, this will result in a large binary that takes a long time to compile.
Alternatively it is also possible to explicitly specify CUDA architectures.
This may also make sense for a non-native build, for that one should look at the logic in `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/CMakeLists.txt` as a starting point.

To override the default CUDA architectures:

#### 1. Take note of the `Compute Capability` of your NVIDIA devices: ["CUDA: Your GPU Compute > Capability"](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).

```text
GeForce RTX 4090      8.9
GeForce RTX 3080 Ti   8.6
GeForce RTX 3070      8.6
```

#### 2. Manually list each varying `Compute Capability` in the `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` list.

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="86;89"
```

### Overriding the CUDA Version

If you have multiple CUDA installations on your system and want to compile llama.cpp for a specific one, e.g. for CUDA 11.7 installed under `/opt/cuda-11.7`:

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/opt/cuda-11.7/bin/nvcc -DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH="/opt/cuda-11.7/lib64;\$ORIGIN" -DCMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=ON
```

#### Fixing Compatibility Issues with Old CUDA and New glibc

If you try to use an old CUDA version (e.g. v11.7) with a new glibc version you can get errors like this:

```
/usr/include/bits/mathcalls.h(83): error: exception specification is
  incompatible with that of previous function "cospi"


  /opt/cuda-11.7/bin/../targets/x86_64-linux/include/crt/math_functions.h(5545):
  here
```

It seems the least bad solution is to patch the CUDA installation to declare the correct signatures.
Replace the following lines in `/path/to/your/cuda/installation/targets/x86_64-linux/include/crt/math_functions.h`:

```C++
// original lines
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ double                 cospi(double x);
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ float                  cospif(float x);
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ double                 sinpi(double x);
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ float                  sinpif(float x);
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ double                 rsqrt(double x);
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ float                  rsqrtf(float x);

// edited lines
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ double                 cospi(double x) noexcept (true);
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ float                  cospif(float x) noexcept (true);
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ double                 sinpi(double x) noexcept (true);
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ float                  sinpif(float x) noexcept (true);
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ double                 rsqrt(double x) noexcept (true);
extern __DEVICE_FUNCTIONS_DECL__ __device_builtin__ float                  rsqrtf(float x) noexcept (true);
```

### Runtime CUDA environmental variables

You may set the [cuda environmental variables](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#env-vars) at runtime.

```bash
# Use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to hide the first compute device.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="-0" ./build/bin/llama-server --model /srv/models/llama.gguf
```

#### CUDA_SCALE_LAUNCH_QUEUES

The environment variable [`CUDA_SCALE_LAUNCH_QUEUES`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/05-appendices/environment-variables.html#cuda-scale-launch-queues) controls the size of CUDA's command buffer, which determines how many GPU operations can be queued before the CPU must wait for the GPU to catch up. A larger buffer reduces CPU-side stalls and allows more work to be queued on a GPU.

Consider setting `CUDA_SCALE_LAUNCH_QUEUES=4x`, which increases the CUDA command buffer to 4 times its default size. This optimization is particularly beneficial for **Multi-GPU setups with pipeline parallelism**, where it significantly improves prompt processing throughput by allowing more operations to be enqueued across GPUs.

#### GGML_CUDA_CUBLAS_COMPUTE_TYPE

Override default, speed-optimized compute types for cuBLAS matrix multiplications.
Legal values: `auto`, `f16`, `fp16`, `bf16`, `f32`, `fp32`.

### Unified Memory

The environment variable `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1` can be used to enable unified memory in Linux. This allows swapping to system RAM instead of crashing when the GPU VRAM is exhausted. In Windows this setting is available in the NVIDIA control panel as `System Memory Fallback`.

### Peer Access

The environment variable `GGML_CUDA_P2P` can be set to enable peer-to-peer access between multiple GPUs, allowing them to transfer data directly rather than to go through system memory.
Requires driver support (usually restricted to workstation/datacenter GPUs).
May cause crashes or corrupted outputs for some motherboards and BIOS settings (e.g. IOMMU).

### Performance Tuning

The following compilation options are also available to tweak performance:

| Option                        | Legal values           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GGML_CUDA_FORCE_MMQ           | Boolean                | false   | Force the use of custom matrix multiplication kernels for quantized models instead of FP16 cuBLAS even if there is no int8 tensor core implementation available (affects V100, CDNA and RDNA3+). MMQ kernels are enabled by default on GPUs with int8 tensor core support. With MMQ force enabled, speed for large batch sizes will be worse but VRAM consumption will be lower. |
| GGML_CUDA_FORCE_CUBLAS        | Boolean                | false   | Force the use of FP16 cuBLAS instead of custom matrix multiplication kernels for quantized models. There may be issues with numerical overflows (except for V100, CDNA and RDNA4 which use FP32 compute type by default) and memory use will be higher. Prompt processing may become faster on recent datacenter GPUs (the custom kernels were tuned primarily for RTX 3000/4000).   |
| GGML_CUDA_FA_QUANTS           | `all` or `type_K-type_V` list | q4_0-q4_0;q8_0-q8_0;f16-f16;bf16-bf16 | Select which K/V type combinations to compile the FlashAttention CUDA kernels for. `all` compiles every combination, but compilation takes much longer. Otherwise a `;`-separated list of `type_K-type_V` pairs; f16-f16 is always compiled. Combinations that were not compiled fall back to f16-f16 kernel with a warning. Legal types: f16, bf16, q4_0, q4_1, q5_0, q5_1, q8_0. |
| GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS       | Boolean                | false   | Deprecated alias for `GGML_CUDA_FA_QUANTS=all`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## MUSA

This provides GPU acceleration using a Moore Threads GPU. Make sure to have the [MUSA SDK](https://developer.mthreads.com/musa/musa-sdk) installed.

#### Download directly from Moore Threads

You may find the official downloads here: [Moore Threads developer site](https://developer.mthreads.com/sdk/download/musa).

### Compilation

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_MUSA=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

#### Override Compute Capability Specifications

By default, all supported compute capabilities are enabled. To customize this behavior, you can specify the `MUSA_ARCHITECTURES` option in the CMake command:

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_MUSA=ON -DMUSA_ARCHITECTURES="21"
cmake --build build --config Release
```

This configuration enables only compute capability `2.1` (MTT S80) during compilation, which can help reduce compilation time.

#### Compilation options

Most of the compilation options available for CUDA should also be available for MUSA, though they haven't been thoroughly tested yet.

- For static builds, add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` and `-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON`:
  ```
  cmake -B build -DGGML_MUSA=ON \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON
  cmake --build build --config Release
  ```

### Runtime MUSA environmental variables

You may set the [musa environmental variables](https://docs.mthreads.com/musa-sdk/musa-sdk-doc-online/programming_guide/Z%E9%99%84%E5%BD%95/) at runtime.

```bash
# Use `MUSA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to hide the first compute device.
MUSA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="-0" ./build/bin/llama-server --model /srv/models/llama.gguf
```

### Unified Memory

The environment variable `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1` can be used to enable unified memory in Linux. This allows swapping to system RAM instead of crashing when the GPU VRAM is exhausted.

## HIP

This provides GPU acceleration on HIP-supported AMD GPUs.
Make sure to have ROCm installed.
You can download it from your Linux distro's package manager or from here: [ROCm Quick Start (Linux)](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/tutorial/quick-start.html#rocm-install-quick).

- Using `CMake` for Linux (assuming a gfx1030-compatible AMD GPU):
  ```bash
  HIPCXX="$(hipconfig -l)/clang" HIP_PATH="$(hipconfig -R)" \
      cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DGPU_TARGETS=gfx1030 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      && cmake --build build --config Release -- -j 16
  ```

  Note: `GPU_TARGETS` is optional, omitting it will build the code for all GPUs in the current system.

  Note that if you get the following error:
  ```
  clang: error: cannot find ROCm device library; provide its path via '--rocm-path' or '--rocm-device-lib-path', or pass '-nogpulib' to build without ROCm device library
  ```
  Try searching for a directory under `HIP_PATH` that contains the file
  `oclc_abi_version_400.bc`. Then, add the following to the start of the
  command: `HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH=<directory-you-just-found>`, so something
  like:
  ```bash
  HIPCXX="$(hipconfig -l)/clang" HIP_PATH="$(hipconfig -p)" \
  HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH=<directory-you-just-found> \
      cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DGPU_TARGETS=gfx1030 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      && cmake --build build -- -j 16
  ```

- Using `CMake` for Windows (using x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS, and assuming a gfx1100-compatible AMD GPU):
  ```bash
  set PATH=%HIP_PATH%\bin;%PATH%
  cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DGPU_TARGETS=gfx1100 -DGGML_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  cmake --build build
  ```
  If necessary, adapt `GPU_TARGETS` to the GPU arch you want to compile for. The above example uses `gfx1100` that corresponds to Radeon RX 7900XTX/XT/GRE. You can find a list of targets [here](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#processors)
  Find your gpu version string by matching the most significant version information from `rocminfo | grep gfx | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'` with the list of processors, e.g. `gfx1035` maps to `gfx1030`.


The environment variable [`HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/understand/gpu_isolation.html#hip-visible-devices) can be used to specify which GPU(s) will be used.
If your GPU is not officially supported you can use the environment variable [`HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`] set to a similar GPU, for example 10.3.0 on RDNA2 (e.g. gfx1030, gfx1031, or gfx1035) or 11.0.0 on RDNA3. Note that [`HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`] is [not supported on Windows](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/2654)

### Unified Memory

On Linux it is possible to use unified memory architecture (UMA) to share main memory between the CPU and integrated GPU by setting environment variable `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1`. However, this hurts performance for non-integrated GPUs (but enables working with integrated GPUs).

## Vulkan

### For Windows Users:
**w64devkit**

Download and extract [`w64devkit`](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit/releases).

Download and install the [`Vulkan SDK`](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) with the default settings.

Launch `w64devkit.exe` and run the following commands to copy Vulkan dependencies:
```sh

cmake --build build --config Release
```

**Git Bash MINGW64**

Download and install [`Git-SCM`](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) with the default settings

Download and install [`Visual Studio Community Edition`](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and make sure you select `C++`

Download and install [`CMake`](https://cmake.org/download/) with the default settings

Download and install the [`Vulkan SDK`](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) with the default settings.

Go into your `llama.cpp` directory and right click, select `Open Git Bash Here` and then run the following commands

```
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Now you can load the model in conversation mode using `Vulkan`

```sh
build/bin/Release/llama-cli -m "[PATH TO MODEL]" -ngl 100 -c 16384 -t 10 -n -2 -cnv
```

**MSYS2**

Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and then run the following commands in a UCRT terminal to install dependencies.
```sh
pacman -S git \
    mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc \
    mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake \
    mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-vulkan-devel \
    mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-shaderc \
    mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-spirv-headers
```

Switch into the `llama.cpp` directory and build using CMake.
```sh
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### For Docker users:

You don't need to install the Vulkan SDK. It will be installed inside the container.

```sh
# Build the image
docker build -t llama-cpp-vulkan --target light -f .devops/vulkan.Dockerfile .

# Then, use it:
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/app:Z" --device /dev/dri/renderD128:/dev/dri/renderD128 --device /dev/dri/card1:/dev/dri/card1 llama-cpp-vulkan -m "/app/models/YOUR_MODEL_FILE" -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 400 -e -ngl 33
```

### For Linux users:

#### Using the LunarG Vulkan SDK

First, follow the official LunarG instructions for the installation and setup of the Vulkan SDK in the [Getting Started with the Linux Tarball Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/linux/getting_started.html) guide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After completing the first step, ensure that you have used the `source` command on the `setup_env.sh` file inside of the Vulkan SDK in your current terminal session. Otherwise, the build won't work. Additionally, if you close out of your terminal, you must perform this step again if you intend to perform a build. However, there are ways to make this persistent. Refer to the Vulkan SDK guide linked in the first step for more information about any of this.

#### Using system packages

On Debian / Ubuntu, you can install the required dependencies using:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libvulkan-dev glslc spirv-headers
```

SPIRV-Headers (`spirv/unified1/spirv.hpp`) are required for the Vulkan backend and are **not** always pulled in by the Vulkan loader dev package alone. Other distros use names such as `spirv-headers` (Ubuntu / Debian / Arch), or `spirv-headers-devel` (Fedora / openSUSE). On Windows, the LunarG Vulkan SDK’s `Include` directory already contains these headers.

#### Common steps

Second, after verifying that you have followed all of the SDK installation/setup steps, use this command to make sure before proceeding:
```bash
vulkaninfo
```

Then, assuming you have `cd` into your llama.cpp folder and there are no errors with running `vulkaninfo`, you can proceed to build llama.cpp using the CMake commands below:
```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=1
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Finally, after finishing your build, you should be able to do something like this:
```bash
# Test the output binary
# "-ngl 99" should offload all of the layers to GPU for most (if not all) models.
./build/bin/llama-cli -m "PATH_TO_MODEL" -p "Hi you how are you" -ngl 99

# You should see in the output, ggml_vulkan detected your GPU. For example:
# ggml_vulkan: Using Intel(R) Graphics (ADL GT2) | uma: 1 | fp16: 1 | warp size: 32
```

### For Mac users:

Generally, follow LunarG's [Getting Started with the MacOS Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/mac/getting_started.html) guide for installation and setup of the Vulkan SDK. There are two options of Vulkan drivers on macOS, both of which implement translation layers to map Vulkan to Metal. They can be hot-swapped by setting the `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` environment variable to point to the respective ICD JSON file.

Check the box for "KosmicKrisp" during the LunarG Vulkan SDK installation.

Set environment variable for the LunarG Vulkan SDK after installation (and optionally add to your shell profile for persistence):
```bash
source /path/to/vulkan-sdk/setup-env.sh
```

#### Using MoltenVK

MoltenVK is the default Vulkan driver installed with the LunarG Vulkan SDK on macOS, so you can use the above environment variable settings as is.

#### Using KosmicKrisp

Override the environment variable for KosmicKrisp:
```bash
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=$VULKAN_SDK/share/vulkan/icd.d/libkosmickrisp_icd.json
export VK_DRIVER_FILES=$VULKAN_SDK/share/vulkan/icd.d/libkosmickrisp_icd.json
```

#### Build

This is the only step different from [above](#common-steps) instructions.
```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=1 -DGGML_METAL=OFF
cmake --build build --config Release
```

## CANN
This provides NPU acceleration using the AI cores of your Ascend NPU. And [CANN](https://www.hiascend.com/en/software/cann) is a hierarchical APIs to help you to quickly build AI applications and service based on Ascend NPU.

For more information about Ascend NPU in [Ascend Community](https://www.hiascend.com/en/).

Make sure to have the CANN toolkit installed. You can download it from here: [CANN Toolkit](https://www.hiascend.com/developer/download/community/result?module=cann)

Go to `llama.cpp` directory and build using CMake.
```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CANN=on -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
cmake --build build --config release
```

You can test with:

```bash
./build/bin/llama-cli -m PATH_TO_MODEL -p "Building a website can be done in 10 steps:" -ngl 32
```

If the following info is output on screen, you are using `llama.cpp` with the CANN backend:
```bash
llm_load_tensors:       CANN model buffer size = 13313.00 MiB
llama_new_context_with_model:       CANN compute buffer size =  1260.81 MiB
```

For detailed info, such as model/device supports, CANN install, please refer to [llama.cpp for CANN](./backend/CANN.md).

## ZenDNN

ZenDNN provides optimized deep learning primitives for AMD EPYC™ CPUs. It accelerates matrix multiplication operations for inference workloads.

### Compilation

- Using `CMake` on Linux (automatic build):

    ```bash
    cmake -B build -DGGML_ZENDNN=ON
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

    The first build will automatically download and build ZenDNN, which may take 5-10 minutes. Subsequent builds will be much faster.

- Using `CMake` with custom ZenDNN installation:

    ```bash
    cmake -B build -DGGML_ZENDNN=ON -DZENDNN_ROOT=/path/to/zendnn/install
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

### Testing

You can test with:

```bash
./build/bin/llama-cli -m PATH_TO_MODEL -p "Building a website can be done in 10 steps:" -n 50
```

For detailed information about hardware support, setup instructions, and performance optimization, refer to [llama.cpp for ZenDNN](./backend/ZenDNN.md).

## Arm® KleidiAI™
KleidiAI provides optimized Arm CPU microkernels used by the ggml CPU backend. Enabling it at build time makes those kernels available; it does not force every operation to use KleidiAI. At runtime, llama.cpp selects the best compatible CPU kernel from the detected CPU features, tensor type, operation shape, and active backend priority.

Supported targets:

| Platform | Supported ABI / architecture | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | AArch64 / arm64 | Runtime CPU feature detection is automatic. |
| Android | `arm64-v8a` | Use the Android NDK command below for a portable build. |
| Apple | arm64 | Runtime CPU feature detection is automatic. Non-streaming SVE vector length is treated as unavailable. |
| Windows | arm64 | Runtime CPU feature detection is automatic. SMCU count is treated as unknown until a detection path is verified. |

`GGML_CPU_KLEIDIAI=ON` is valid only for AArch64/arm64 builds. Do not enable it for x86, 32-bit Arm, or Android ABIs other than `arm64-v8a`.

### Native AArch64/arm64 build

From the llama.cpp source directory:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_CPU_KLEIDIAI=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Android arm64-v8a NDK build

Set `ANDROID_NDK` to the Android NDK root, then run the following from the llama.cpp source directory. This command configures a portable Android `arm64-v8a` build with KleidiAI enabled and avoids Android dependencies that are not part of the NDK stable native API set.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-android \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" \
  -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a \
  -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-28 \
  -DGGML_CPU_KLEIDIAI=ON \
  -DGGML_NATIVE=OFF \
  -DGGML_OPENMP=OFF \
  -DGGML_LLAMAFILE=OFF \
  -DLLAMA_OPENSSL=OFF
cmake --build build-android --config Release --parallel
cmake --install build-android --prefix {install-dir} --config Release
```

Important Android options:

- `GGML_CPU_KLEIDIAI=ON` enables KleidiAI for Android `arm64-v8a`.
- `GGML_NATIVE=OFF` is required for cross-compilation because the build host CPU is not the Android target CPU.
- `GGML_OPENMP=OFF` avoids adding an OpenMP runtime dependency to this NDK command-line build.
- `GGML_LLAMAFILE=OFF` avoids the llamafile backend, which is not supported on Android.
- `LLAMA_OPENSSL=OFF` avoids depending on OpenSSL, which is not part of the Android NDK stable native API set.

The Android Studio project under `examples/llama.android` enables KleidiAI automatically for `arm64-v8a`. For Android command-line CMake builds on `arm64-v8a`, pass `-DGGML_CPU_KLEIDIAI=ON` explicitly.

Global -march flags such as `-march=armv8.7a` flag are not required for a portable Android `arm64-v8a` build. Global `-march` flags raise the baseline instruction set for generic code. No manual architecture-specific source selection is required; llama.cpp selects compatible KleidiAI kernels at runtime. The KleidiAI libraries internal CMake handles the -march flags for each particular kernel.

### Verifying the build

Run an installed or in-tree binary:

```bash
./build/bin/llama-cli -m PATH_TO_MODEL -p "What is a car?"
```

If KleidiAI is enabled, the output contains a line similar to:

```
load_tensors: CPU_KLEIDIAI model buffer size =  3474.00 MiB
```

This confirms that the model has tensors allocated through the KleidiAI CPU buffer. It does not prove that every operation, or any specific SME-family operation, used a KleidiAI microkernel. Runtime CPU features, tensor type, operation shape, and backend priority still control dispatch.

Depending on the build target, another backend may have higher priority than the CPU backend. To force CPU execution for a run, disable higher priority backends at build time, for example `-DGGML_METAL=OFF`, or use a runtime device option such as `--device none` where supported.

### Runtime dispatch

KleidiAI microkernels use Arm CPU features such as dotprod, i8mm, SVE, and SME/SME2. Build-time configuration makes the kernels available. Runtime dispatch selects a compatible kernel for the detected CPU and operation. Older or lower-feature CPUs fall back automatically to compatible kernels.

KleidiAI accelerates selected `GGML_OP_MUL_MAT` paths for F32 and common quantized formats. Exact coverage depends on the bundled KleidiAI version and the llama.cpp runtime selector, so unsupported tensor types, unsupported operation shapes, or higher priority backends may bypass KleidiAI even when the CPU supports the required Arm feature. This is also why a model may not use SME-family kernels on SME-capable hardware.

The current llama.cpp KleidiAI SVE selector only enables SVE kernels when the runtime SVE vector length is known to be QK8_0 bytes, currently 32 bytes. Linux and Android query this at runtime. Apple reports SVE capability separately from userspace non-streaming SVE availability, so llama.cpp treats the SVE vector length as unknown there. Windows exposes SVE feature presence but not the runtime SVE vector length used by this selector, so that value is also treated as unknown. Windows arm64 also treats SMCU count as unknown until a detection mechanism is verified.

The set of available SME-family kernels depends on the bundled KleidiAI version and the detected CPU capabilities. Production configuration does not require any KleidiAI runtime environment variables.

### Diagnostics and debug overrides

KleidiAI runtime environment variables are diagnostics/debug overrides, not production configuration. Leave them unset for normal use.

`GGML_KLEIDIAI_SME` controls SME-family kernel selection and overrides the maximum number of threads assigned to selected quantized SME-family kernels:

- Not set: use automatic runtime detection.
- `0`: disable SME-family kernels.
- `<n> > 0`: enable compatible SME-family kernels and allow up to `<n>` threads for quantized SME-family kernels.

On Windows arm64, use `GGML_KLEIDIAI_SME=<n>` as the temporary diagnostics/debug override for SME thread-cap calibration until automatic SMCU count detection is verified.

If the CPU does not support the required SME-family capability for a bundled kernel, that kernel is disabled regardless of the environment variable.

## OpenCL

This provides GPU acceleration through OpenCL on recent Adreno GPU.
More information about OpenCL backend can be found in [OPENCL.md](./backend/OPENCL.md) for more information.

### Android

Assume NDK is available in `$ANDROID_NDK`. First, install OpenCL headers and ICD loader library if not available,

```sh
mkdir -p ~/dev/llm
cd ~/dev/llm

git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Headers && \
cd OpenCL-Headers && \
cp -r CL $ANDROID_NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/sysroot/usr/include

cd ~/dev/llm

git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-ICD-Loader && \
cd OpenCL-ICD-Loader && \
mkdir build_ndk && cd build_ndk && \
cmake .. -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
  -DOPENCL_ICD_LOADER_HEADERS_DIR=$ANDROID_NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/sysroot/usr/include \
  -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a \
  -DANDROID_PLATFORM=24 \
  -DANDROID_STL=c++_shared && \
ninja && \
cp libOpenCL.so $ANDROID_NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/sysroot/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-android
```

Then build llama.cpp with OpenCL enabled,

```sh
cd ~/dev/llm

git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp && \
cd llama.cpp && \
mkdir build-android && cd build-android

cmake .. -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
  -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a \
  -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-28 \
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
  -DGGML_OPENCL=ON

ninja
```

### Windows Arm64

First, install OpenCL headers and ICD loader library if not available,

```powershell
mkdir -p ~/dev/llm

cd ~/dev/llm
git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Headers && cd OpenCL-Headers
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja `
  -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF `
  -DOPENCL_HEADERS_BUILD_TESTING=OFF `
  -DOPENCL_HEADERS_BUILD_CXX_TESTS=OFF `
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/dev/llm/opencl"
cmake --build . --target install

cd ~/dev/llm
git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-ICD-Loader && cd OpenCL-ICD-Loader
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja `
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release `
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/dev/llm/opencl" `
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/dev/llm/opencl"
cmake --build . --target install
```

Then build llama.cpp with OpenCL enabled,

```powershell
cmake .. -G Ninja `
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$HOME/dev/llm/llama.cpp/cmake/arm64-windows-llvm.cmake" `
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release `
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/dev/llm/opencl" `
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF `
  -DGGML_OPENCL=ON
ninja
```

## Android

To read documentation for how to build on Android, [click here](./android.md)

## WebGPU

The WebGPU backend relies on [Dawn](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn). Follow the instructions [here](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn/+/refs/heads/main/docs/quickstart-cmake.md) to install Dawn locally so that llama.cpp can find it using CMake. The current implementation is up-to-date with Dawn commit `94c3c9c`.

In the llama.cpp directory, build with CMake:

```
cmake -B build -DGGML_WEBGPU=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Browser Support

WebGPU allows cross-platform access to the GPU from supported browsers. We utilize [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) to compile ggml's WebGPU backend to WebAssembly. Emscripten does not officially support WebGPU bindings yet, but Dawn currently maintains its own WebGPU bindings called emdawnwebgpu.

Follow the instructions [here](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn/+/refs/heads/main/src/emdawnwebgpu/) to download or build the emdawnwebgpu package (Note that it might be safer to build the emdawnwebgpu package locally, so that it stays in sync with the version of Dawn you have installed above). When building using CMake, the path to the emdawnwebgpu port file needs to be set with the flag `EMDAWNWEBGPU_DIR`.

## IBM Z & LinuxONE

To read documentation for how to build on IBM Z & LinuxONE, [click here](./build-s390x.md)

## OpenVINO

[OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/) is an open-source toolkit for optimizing and deploying high-performance AI inference, specifically designed for Intel hardware (CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs).

For build instructions and usage examples, refer to [OPENVINO.md](backend/OPENVINO.md).

### Hexagon

Check [README.md](./backend/snapdragon/README.md) for target specific build and run info.

## Notes about GPU-accelerated backends

The GPU may still be used to accelerate some parts of the computation even when using the `-ngl 0` option. You can fully disable GPU acceleration by using `--device none`.

In most cases, it is possible to build and use multiple backends at the same time. For example, you can build llama.cpp with both CUDA and Vulkan support by using the `-DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_VULKAN=ON` options with CMake. At runtime, you can specify which backend devices to use with the `--device` option. To see a list of available devices, use the `--list-devices` option.

Backends can be built as dynamic libraries that can be loaded dynamically at runtime. This allows you to use the same llama.cpp binary on different machines with different GPUs. To enable this feature, use the `GGML_BACKEND_DL` option when building.
## Build profiling
This page is a working document for analyzing the current build and try to
identify ways to improve the build time.

### Requirements
The profiling script requires clang to be used as the compiler tool chain and
also requires that ClangBuildAnalyzer is installed.

Mac:
```console
brew install clang-build-analyzer
```

Linux:
```console
git clone https://github.com/aras-p/ClangBuildAnalyzer.git
cd ClangBuildAnalyzer
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
sudo cp build/ClangBuildAnalyzer /usr/local/bin/
```

Windows: install LLVM/clang and Ninja (e.g. via the
[LLVM releases page](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) and
`winget install Ninja-build.Ninja`), then build ClangBuildAnalyzer the same
way as on Linux:
```console
git clone https://github.com/aras-p/ClangBuildAnalyzer.git
cd ClangBuildAnalyzer
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```
Then add `ClangBuildAnalyzer\build` to `PATH`.

### Usage
Mac/Linux:
```console
$ ./scripts/build-profile.sh
```

Windows:
```console
> .\scripts\build-profile.ps1
```

Both accept `--full`/`-Full` (include Server, Tools, and Tests) and a jobs
override (`-jN` / `-Jobs N`).

Note: on Windows, `cmake` defaults to the Visual Studio generator, which
ignores `CMAKE_C_COMPILER`/`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` and silently falls back to
MSVC. `build-profile.ps1` passes `-G Ninja` so clang is actually used, this
is required on ARM64.

## Build llama.cpp locally (for riscv64)

1. Prepare Toolchain For RISCV
~~~
wget https://github.com/spacemit-com/toolchain/releases/download/v1.2.4/spacemit-toolchain-linux-glibc-x86_64-v1.2.4.tar.xz
~~~

2. Build
Below is the build script: it requires utilizing RISC-V vector instructions for acceleration. Ensure the `GGML_CPU_RISCV64_SPACEMIT` compilation option is enabled. The currently supported optimization version is `RISCV64_SPACEMIT_IME1` and `RISCV64_SPACEMIT_IME2`, corresponding to the `RISCV64_SPACEMIT_IME_SPEC` compilation option. Compiler configurations are defined in the `riscv64-spacemit-linux-gnu-gcc.cmake` file. Please ensure you have installed the RISC-V compiler and set the environment variable via `export RISCV_ROOT_PATH={your_compiler_path}`.
```bash

cmake -B build \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DGGML_CPU_RISCV64_SPACEMIT=ON \
    -DGGML_CPU_REPACK=OFF \
    -DLLAMA_OPENSSL=OFF \
    -DGGML_RVV=ON \
    -DGGML_RV_ZVFH=ON \
    -DGGML_RV_ZFH=ON \
    -DGGML_RV_ZICBOP=ON \
    -DGGML_RV_ZIHINTPAUSE=ON \
    -DGGML_RV_ZBA=ON \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${PWD}/cmake/riscv64-spacemit-linux-gnu-gcc.cmake \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=build/installed

cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc) --config Release

pushd build
make install
popd
```

## Simulation
You can use QEMU to perform emulation on non-RISC-V architectures.

1. Download QEMU

# Build llama.cpp locally (for s390x)

The main product of this project is the `llama` library. Its C-style interface can be found in [include/llama.h](../include/llama.h).

The project also includes many example programs and tools using the `llama` library. The examples range from simple, minimal code snippets to sophisticated sub-projects such as an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server.

**To get the code:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
```

## CPU Build with BLAS

Building llama.cpp with BLAS support is highly recommended as it has shown to provide performance improvements. Make sure to have OpenBLAS installed in your environment.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build             \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
    -DGGML_BLAS=ON              \
    -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS

cmake --build build --config Release -j $(nproc)
```

**Notes**:

-   For faster repeated compilation, install [ccache](https://ccache.dev/)
-   By default, VXE/VXE2 is enabled. To disable it (not recommended):

    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build             \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
        -DGGML_BLAS=ON              \
        -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS \
        -DGGML_VXE=OFF

    cmake --build build --config Release -j $(nproc)
    ```

-   For debug builds:

    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build             \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug    \
        -DGGML_BLAS=ON              \
        -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS
    cmake --build build --config Debug -j $(nproc)
    ```

-   For static builds, add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`:

    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build             \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
        -DGGML_BLAS=ON              \
        -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS \
        -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF

    cmake --build build --config Release -j $(nproc)
    ```

## IBM zDNN Accelerator

This provides acceleration using the IBM zAIU co-processor located in the Telum I and Telum II processors. Make sure to have the [IBM zDNN library](https://github.com/IBM/zDNN) installed.

#### Compile from source from IBM

You may find the official build instructions here: [Building and Installing zDNN](https://github.com/IBM/zDNN?tab=readme-ov-file#building-and-installing-zdnn)

### Compilation

```bash
cmake -S . -B build             \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  \
    -DGGML_ZDNN=ON
cmake --build build --config Release -j$(nproc)
```

## Getting GGUF Models

All models need to be converted to Big-Endian. You can achieve this in three cases:

1. **Use pre-converted models verified for use on IBM Z & LinuxONE (easiest)**

    ![File Type - gguf](https://img.shields.io/badge/File_Type-gguf-fff)

    You can find popular models pre-converted and verified at [s390x Verified Models](https://huggingface.co/collections/taronaeo/s390x-verified-models-672765393af438d0ccb72a08) or [s390x Runnable Models](https://huggingface.co/collections/taronaeo/s390x-runnable-models-686e951824198df12416017e).

    These models have already been converted from `safetensors` to `GGUF` Big-Endian and their respective tokenizers verified to run correctly on IBM z15 and later system.

2. **Convert safetensors model to GGUF Big-Endian directly (recommended)**

    ![File Type - safetensors](https://img.shields.io/badge/File_Type-safetensors-da1e28)

    The model you are trying to convert must be in `safetensors` file format (for example [IBM Granite 3.3 2B](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct)). Make sure you have downloaded the model repository for this case.

    Ensure that you have installed the required packages in advance

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Convert the `safetensors` model to `GGUF`

    ```bash
    python3 convert_hf_to_gguf.py \
        --outfile model-name-be.f16.gguf \
        --outtype f16 \
        --bigendian \
        model-directory/
    ```

    For example,

    ```bash
    python3 convert_hf_to_gguf.py \
        --outfile granite-3.3-2b-instruct-be.f16.gguf \
        --outtype f16 \
        --bigendian \
        granite-3.3-2b-instruct/
    ```

3. **Convert existing GGUF Little-Endian model to Big-Endian**

    ![File Type - gguf](https://img.shields.io/badge/File_Type-gguf-fff)

    The model you are trying to convert must be in `gguf` file format (for example [IBM Granite 3.3 2B GGUF](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct-GGUF)). Make sure you have downloaded the model file for this case.

    ```bash
    python3 gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_convert_endian.py model-name.f16.gguf BIG
    ```

    For example,

    ```bash
    python3 gguf-py/gguf/scripts/gguf_convert_endian.py granite-3.3-2b-instruct-le.f16.gguf BIG
    mv granite-3.3-2b-instruct-le.f16.gguf granite-3.3-2b-instruct-be.f16.gguf
    ```

    **Notes:**

    - The GGUF endian conversion script may not support all data types at the moment and may fail for some models/quantizations. When that happens, please try manually converting the safetensors model to GGUF Big-Endian via Step 2.

## IBM Accelerators

### 1. SIMD Acceleration

Only available in IBM z15/LinuxONE 3 or later system with the `-DGGML_VXE=ON` (turned on by default) compile flag. No hardware acceleration is possible with llama.cpp with older systems, such as IBM z14/arch12. In such systems, the APIs can still run but will use a scalar implementation.

### 2. zDNN Accelerator (WIP)

Only available in IBM z17/LinuxONE 5 or later system with the `-DGGML_ZDNN=ON` compile flag. No hardware acceleration is possible with llama.cpp with older systems, such as IBM z15/arch13. In such systems, the APIs will default back to CPU routines.

### 3. Spyre Accelerator

_Only available with IBM z17 / LinuxONE 5 or later system. No support currently available._

## Performance Tuning

### 1. Virtualization Setup

It is strongly recommended to use only LPAR (Type-1) virtualization to get the most performance.

Note: Type-2 virtualization is not supported at the moment, while you can get it running, the performance will not be the best.

### 2. IFL (Core) Count

It is recommended to allocate a minimum of 8 shared IFLs assigned to the LPAR. Increasing the IFL count past 8 shared IFLs will only improve Prompt Processing performance but not Token Generation.

Note: IFL count does not equate to vCPU count.

### 3. SMT vs NOSMT (Simultaneous Multithreading)

It is strongly recommended to disable SMT via the kernel boot parameters as it negatively affects performance. Please refer to your Linux distribution's guide on disabling SMT via kernel boot parameters.

### 4. BLAS vs NOBLAS

IBM VXE/VXE2 SIMD acceleration depends on the BLAS implementation. It is strongly recommended to use BLAS.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. I'm getting the following error message while trying to load a model: `gguf_init_from_file_impl: failed to load model: this GGUF file version 50331648 is extremely large, is there a mismatch between the host and model endianness?`

    Answer: Please ensure that the model you have downloaded/converted is GGUFv3 Big-Endian. These models are usually denoted with the `-be` suffix, i.e., `granite-3.3-2b-instruct-be.F16.gguf`.

    You may refer to the [Getting GGUF Models](#getting-gguf-models) section to manually convert a `safetensors` model to `GGUF` Big Endian.

2. I'm getting extremely poor performance when running inference on a model

    Answer: Please refer to the [Appendix B: SIMD Support Matrix](#appendix-b-simd-support-matrix) to check if your model quantization is supported by SIMD acceleration.

3. I'm building on IBM z17 and getting the following error messages: `invalid switch -march=z17`

    Answer: Please ensure that your GCC compiler is of minimum GCC 15.1.0 version, and have `binutils` updated to the latest version. If this does not fix the problem, kindly open an issue.

4. Failing to install the `sentencepiece` package using GCC 15+

    Answer: The `sentencepiece` team are aware of this as seen in [this issue](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/issues/1108).

    As a temporary workaround, please run the installation command with the following environment variables.

    ```bash
    export CXXFLAGS="-include cstdint"
    ```

    For example,

    ```bash
    CXXFLAGS="-include cstdint" pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
